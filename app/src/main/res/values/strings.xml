        <h2><font color=#FF0000>1. Factor:</h2>
        <p >When a number x divide another number y exactly then we say x is factor of y or y is multiple of x.</p>

        <h2><font color=#FF0000>2. Highest Common Factor (HCF) or Greateast Common Measure(GCM) or Greateast Common Divisor:</h2>
        <p>HCF of the given numbers is the heighest number which divides each of given number exactly.<br /><br /> Consider the numbers 12 and 15: <br />The factors of 12 are : 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.<br />The factors of 15 are : 1, 3, 5, 15.<br /><br />1 and 3 are the only common factors (numbers which are factors of both 12 and 15).</p><br />

        <h2 ><font color=#FF0000>3. Least Common Factor(LCM):</h2>
        <p>LCM of given numbers is the least number which is exactly divisible by given numbers.<br /><br />Consider the numbers 12 and 15 again:<br />The multiples of 12 are : 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84.<br /> The multiples of 15 are : 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90. <br /> <br />60 is a common multiple (a multiple of both 12 and 15), and there are no lower common multiples. Therefore, the lowest common multiple of 12 and 15 is 60.</p><br />


        <h2 ><font color=#FF0000>4. Formulas:</h2>
        <p>1. Product of two numbers = product of(HCF & LCM).<br /><br />2. HCF of fraction = HCF of Numerators/LCM of Denominators.<br /><br />3.LCM of fraction = LCM of Numerators/HCF of Denominators.<br /><br /></p><br />

In most of quants questions we face  little bit complex addition ,subtraction ,division and multiplication problems. Sometimes this type of problems donâ€™t require full solution. Just by examine of question or by analyzing answer option we can answer correctly.<br /><br />
Some easy tricks are here which can be helpful to solve the complex question in minimum time: <br /><br />

<h2><font color=#FF0000>1. Last digit:</font></h2>When there is a question in which operation (sum/subtraction/multiply/divide) is performed on some numbers. So by calculating last digit we can tick answer. If you want apply last digit 2 conditions must be followed by questions:<br /><br />

 1.In answer options no option should be like-NOT/None of these/Cant determine.<br />
 2.last digit of each answer option should be different.<br /> <br />
explanation :-  <br /> <br />
456823*12546 <br /> <br />
A.5731301367<br />
B.5731301358<br />
C.5731301394<br />
D.5731301356 <br /> <br />
this question follow both the rules so we can apply last digit.<br /> <br />
here in first number 456823 last digit is 3 and in second number 12546 last digit is 6  if we multiply both last digit: <br />
6*3 = 18    <br />
here last digit is- 8 so in ans last digit 8 in option B. like this we can solve any complex operations using last digit.<br /> <br />


<h2><font color=#FF0000>2. Lucky digit:</font></h2>Last digit concept you cant apply for all the question. When answer options having same last digit for example see :<br /><br />

Explanation <br /><br />
456823*12546 <br /><br />
A.5731301778<br />
B.5731301358<br />
C.5731301338<br />
D.5731301228<br /><br />

here we will apply a trick called lucky digit.<br /><br />

Digit 9 is known here as a lucky digit.follow these steps to calculate answer using lucky digit:<br /><br />
1. First calculate lucky digit for your question.take first number of your question.i.e 456823<br /><br />
2. Eliminate 9 or the digits which gives sum equals to 9.<br />
ex: eliminate 5&4 (5+4=9),6&3(6+3=9).<br /><br />
3.Calculate sum of remaining digits.<br /><br />
4.If it is one digit from 0-9 then fine if it is greater than 9 then calculate sum of digits it will be your lucky digit.<br />
ex. Remaining digit 8& 2 sum =10, sum of digit=1, its your lucky digit.<br /><br />
5.Again calculate for second number i.e 12546. at last you got 0.but consider it 9 as lucky digit.<br /><br />
6.Now do the question as its given to find multiply  (1*9=9).9 is lucky digit for this question.<br /><br />
7.Now calculate same  for answers options.<br /><br />

Explaination:<br /><br />
A. 5731301778 <br /><br /> here eliminate 5,1,3 & 8,1 now remaining is(7+3+0+7+7=24 lucky digit is 2+4=6)<br /><br />
B. 5731301358 <br /><br /> here eliminate(5,31&1,3,5 now remaining is(7+3+0+8=18 lucky digit is 1+8=9) same lucky digit as question it will be your answer.<br /><br />
